# To-Do-List Project
A to-do list is a time management tool used to list all tasks or activities that need to be completed. It serves as a reminder of what needs to be completed, allowing users to organize their work or personal lives more effectively.

## Objective:

Practice .NET (C#) / SQL Server and Angular (Typescript) / Design Patterns / Onion Architecture.
Familiarize myself with the use of forms in Angular.
Use an API to translate speech to text: Specifically the Web Speech API. This API allows browsers to perform speech recognition tasks, such as transcribing what is being said in real time.

## Features.

BACKEND:
- Onion architecture.
- SOLID principles.
- Use of Entity Framework.
- Pattern design: BaseEntity, Repository (To access the task DB), UnitOfWork, Singleton (To manage the backend configuration) and Factory (To create the task instances).
- Adds HashPassword class to encrypt DB access passwords.
- Add Architecture diagram to explain how the project works.
  
FRONTEND:
- Developed with Angular 18.0.2.
- Module oriented.
- Creation of services and models.
- Web Speech API invocation is added (which allows to incorporate voice data to web applications?
- Unit testing: using frameworks such as Jasmine 4.6.1 and Karma 6.4.4 as test runner.

DB:
- Entity-Relationship Diagram Written with SQL Server.
- Tables (DDLs) and Data (DMLs).
